#Irrespective of the value of Ïƒ, the standard error decreases with the square root of the sample size m.
# Mean squared error (MSE) combines the notions of bias and standard error. It is defined as
#Since we have already determined the bias and standard error of estimator [4.4], calculating its mean squared error is easy: MSE = SE^2 + bias^2 > if bias = 0 MSE = SE^2 ; so SE = sqrt(MSE)
  #Faced with alternative estimators for a given parameter, it is generally reasonable to use the one with the smallest MSE.
#In an analogy to standard deviation, taking the square root of MSE yields the root-mean-square error or root-mean-square deviation (RMSE or RMSD), which has the same units as the quantity being estimated; for an unbiased estimator, the RMSE is the square root of the variance, known as the standard error.
# SE = sd/sqrt(n)
